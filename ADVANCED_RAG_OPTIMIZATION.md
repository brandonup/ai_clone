# Advanced RAG Optimization Guide

## Overview of Optimizations

This document explains the advanced optimizations made to the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system in the AI Coaching Clone application to ensure questions are correctly answered from the knowledge base without relying on specific keywords.

## 1. Fundamental Routing Changes

### Previous Approach (Keyword-Based)
The original implementation used keyword detection to determine whether to use RAG, web search, or base LLM:

```python
# Check for specific keywords to determine route
q_lower = question.lower()
rag_keywords = ["secret", "life", "according to", "mentioned in", ...]
search_terms = ["today", "current", "latest", "news", ...]

if any(keyword in q_lower for keyword in rag_keywords):
    return "force_ragie"
elif any(term in q_lower for term in search_terms):
    return "web"
else:
    return "base"
```

### New Approach (RAG-First)
The optimized implementation always tries RAG first for every question:

```python
def choose_route(question, ragie_chunks):
    # If Ragie returned any chunks, use them
    if ragie_chunks:
        return "ragie"
    
    # Always try RAG first for any question
    return "force_ragie"
```

This ensures that if the answer exists in the knowledge base, it will be found regardless of how the question is phrased.

## 2. Enhanced Retrieval System

### Multiple Query Variations
For each question, we now try multiple variations to maximize matching:

```python
# Try multiple query variations to improve retrieval
queries = [
    query,  # Original query
    f"Find information about: {query}",  # Directive format
    query.replace("?", "").strip()  # Remove question mark
]

all_chunks = []

# Try each query variation
for q in queries:
    result = r_client.retrievals.retrieve(...)
    # Process results...
```

### Improved Chunk Processing
We've enhanced how chunks are processed:

1. **Increased Retrieval Limits**: Retrieving more potential matches (10 instead of 3-5)
2. **Duplicate Removal**: Ensuring unique content while preserving order
3. **Better Scoring**: Sorting by relevance score to prioritize the most relevant content

```python
# Remove duplicates while preserving order
unique_chunks = []
seen_texts = set()

for text, score in all_chunks:
    if text not in seen_texts:
        seen_texts.add(text)
        unique_chunks.append((text, score))

# Sort by score (highest first) and take top_n
unique_chunks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

## 3. Improved Fallback Strategy

The application now has a clear priority order:

1. **RAG First**: Always try to use the knowledge base
2. **Web Search Second**: Only if no relevant content is found in RAG
3. **Base LLM Last**: Only if both RAG and web search fail

```python
# Our enhanced retrieval already tries multiple query variations
# If we still don't have chunks, try web search as fallback
if chunks:
    source = "Knowledge Base (RAG)"
    context = "\n\n".join(chunks)
    answer = generate_answer(question, context=context, persona=coach_persona)
else:
    # Try web search as fallback
    search_context = web_search(question)
    if search_context:
        source = "Web Search"
        answer = generate_answer(question, context=search_context, persona=coach_persona)
    else:
        # If no web results either, use base LLM
        source = "Base LLM"
        answer = generate_answer(question, persona=coach_persona)
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Keyword Dependency**: Works with any question phrasing
2. **Maximum Knowledge Utilization**: Ensures uploaded content is used whenever relevant
3. **Transparent Fallback**: Clear progression from RAG to web to base LLM
4. **Better Matching**: Multiple query variations increase chances of finding relevant content

This approach ensures that if the answer to a question exists in the uploaded documents (like "The secret to life is 43"), the system will find and use it regardless of how the question is phrased.
