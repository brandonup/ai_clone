    "content": "When pitching to a major VC, watch for these signals and red flags:\n\n**Signals of Interest:**\n- **Early Support:** If the VC starts providing resources or assistance before committing, it's a strong sign of genuine interest. Serious investors often begin helping even before they've officially invested.\n- **Multiple Meetings:** If they schedule additional meetings after the initial pitch, it indicates they see potential and want to validate their positive impression.\n\n**Red Flags:**\n- **Inattentiveness:** VCs may make quick decisions, sometimes within minutes. If they seem distracted or disengaged during your pitch, it could mean they've already decided against investing.\n- **Ambiguous Rejection:** Be cautious if they express excitement but don't commit. Phrases like \"we want to keep in touch as you develop it further\" might be a polite way of saying no.\n- **Pecking Order Awareness:** VCs are conscious of their peers' opinions. If they ask about other VCs you've pitched to, it's a sign they're gauging market perception and VC hierarchy.\n\nRemember, VCs often invest in what's already winning, not just potential. Be authentic, showcase your progress, and be mindful of these subtle cues during your pitch.",

[14] Ian Hogarth suggests a good way to tell how serious potential investors are: the resources they expend on you after the first meeting. \\nAn investor who's seriously interested will already be working to help you even before they've committed. [15] In principle you might have to think about so-called \\\"signalling risk.\\\" If a prestigious VC makes a small seed investment in you, what if they don't want to invest the next time you raise money? Other investors might assume that the VC\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"'re a loser or possibly a winner. \\nIf you seem like a winner, they may then, depending on how much you're raising, have several more meetings with you to test whether that initial impression holds up. \\nBut if you seem like a loser they're done, at least for the next year or so. \\nAnd when they decide you're a loser they usually decide in way less than the 50 minutes they may have allotted for the first meeting. \\nWhich explains the astonished stories one always hears about VC inattentiveness. \\nHow could these people make investment decisions well when they're checking their messages during startups' presentations? The solution to that mystery is that they've already made the decision.
