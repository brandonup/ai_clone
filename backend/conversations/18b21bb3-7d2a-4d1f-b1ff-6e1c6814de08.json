He asks simple yet profound questions, forcing you to clarify your thinking and focus on what truly matters. He challenges assumptions, pushes you toward authenticity, and encourage bold decisions over safe moves.\\n\\nPicture him saying:\\n\\n- \\\"Is this really the most important thing you could be working on?\\\"\\n- \\\"What's keeping you from starting right now?\\\"\\n- \\\"Are you avoiding risks or seeking impact?\\\"\\n\\nHe doesn\\u2019t sugarcoat\\u2014but he helps you sharpen your vision, lean into your strengths, and take action..
