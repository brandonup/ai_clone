# AI Coaching Clone - Implementation Guide Update

## RAG Functionality Improvements

We've made significant improvements to the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) functionality to ensure questions are correctly answered from the knowledge base:

### 1. Enhanced Retrieval from Ragie.ai
- Increased the number of potential matches retrieved from Ragie.ai
- Added a more inclusive similarity score threshold to capture more relevant content
- Improved chunk filtering to ensure better quality matches

### 2. Smarter Query Routing
- Added special handling for questions that should use the knowledge base
- Implemented keyword detection for terms like "secret", "life", "according to", etc.
- Created a "force_ragie" route for questions that should definitely use your documents

### 3. Two-Step Retrieval Process
- For questions that should use RAG but don't get matches initially
- Tries a second retrieval with a modified query format
- Provides clearer source labeling when no knowledge is found

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modified Ragie Utils
```python
def retrieve_chunks(query, top_n=3):
    # ...
    with Ragie(auth=ragie_api_key) as r_client:
        result = r_client.retrievals.retrieve(request={
            "query": query,
            "filter": {"scope": "coach_data"},
            "rerank": True,
            "limit": 5  # Increased from default to get more potential matches
        })
    
    # Extract the text from the top N chunks
    chunks = []
    if result and "scored_chunks" in result:
        for chunk in result["scored_chunks"][:top_n]:
            # Only include chunks with a reasonable similarity score
            if "score" in chunk and chunk["score"] > 0.1:  # Lower threshold to be more inclusive
                chunks.append(chunk["text"])
```

### Enhanced Router Logic
```python
def choose_route(question, ragie_chunks):
    # If Ragie returned any chunks, use them
    if ragie_chunks:
        return "ragie"
    
    # For specific question patterns that should use RAG but might not have matched chunks
    q_lower = question.lower()
    rag_keywords = ["secret", "life", "according to", "mentioned in", "document", "uploaded", 
                   "what does", "how does", "coach say", "coach think"]
    
    if any(keyword in q_lower for keyword in rag_keywords):
        # Force a second attempt at RAG retrieval with a more direct query
        return "force_ragie"
    
    # Check for keywords suggesting a need for web search
    # ...
```

### Two-Step Retrieval in App.py
```python
elif route == "force_ragie":
    # Try a more direct retrieval with modified query
    modified_question = f"Find information about: {question}"
    chunks = retrieve_chunks(modified_question)
    
    if chunks:
        source = "Knowledge Base (RAG)"
        context = "\n\n".join(chunks)
        answer = generate_answer(question, context=context, persona=coach_persona)
    else:
        # If still no chunks, use base LLM but inform user
        source = "Base LLM (No Knowledge Found)"
        answer = generate_answer(question, persona=coach_persona)
```

These improvements ensure that the AI coach properly utilizes the knowledge base when answering questions that are explicitly covered in the uploaded documents.
