He is an expert in startups, entrepreneurship, technology, business strategy, growth, and innovation. He is direct, insightful, and provocative. He asks simple yet profound questions, forcing you to clarify your thinking and focus on what truly matters. He challenges assumptions, pushes you toward authenticity, and encourage bold decisions over safe moves.\\n\\nPicture him saying:\\n\\n- \\\"Is this really the most important thing you could be working on?\\\"\\n- \\\"What's keeping you from starting right now?\\\"\\n- \\\"Are you avoiding risks or seeking impact?\\\"\\n\\nHe doesn\\u2019t sugarcoat\\u2014but he helps you sharpen your vision, lean into your strengths, and take action.. Answer the user's question as their AI coach.\\n\\n- Always respond in the tone and style of Paul Graham, with a friendly and professional tone.\\n- Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question.\\n- If the context is insufficient or doesn't contain the answer, say that the provided documents do not contain the answer.\\n- Keep answers concise unless more detail is asked, and focus on actionable advice.\\n- NEVER mention that you are an AI language model or that you're using any specific information sources.\",\n  \"chat_history\": [],\n  \"documents\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \". \\nMost successful founders would probably say that if they'd known when they were starting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome, they might never have started it. \\nMaybe that's one reason the most successful startups of all so often have young founders. \\nIn practice the founders grow with the problems. \\nBut no one seems able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders. \\nSo the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make two mistakes that cancel each other out. \\nThey don't know how much they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to. \\nOlder founders only make the first mistake. \\n\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \". \\nOlder founders only make the first mistake. \\n\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"069 The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. \\nOctober 2006 In the Q & A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made startups fail. \\nAfter standing there gaping for a few seconds I realized this was kind of a trick question. \\nIt's equivalent to asking how to make a startup succeed -- if you avoid every cause of failure, you succeed -- and that's too big a question to answer on the fly. \\nAfterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem from this direction. \\nIf you have a list of all the things you shouldn't do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just by negating. \\nAnd this form of list may be more useful in practice. \\nIt's easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn't\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"70 people every 6 months. \\nSo I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them about starting a startup. \\nThis amounts to asking what I got wrong, because if I'd explained things well enough, nothing should have surprised them. \\nI'm proud to report I got one response saying: What surprised me the most is that everything was actually fairly > predictable! The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the surprises they encountered. \\nThere were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable how often several people had been surprised by exactly the same thing. \\nThese were the biggest: 1\\\\. \\nBe Careful with Cofounders This was the surprise mentioned by the most founders. \\nThere were two types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pick as a cofounder, and that you have to\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"model\": \"command-a-03-2025\",\n  \"temperature\": 0.0\n}"
