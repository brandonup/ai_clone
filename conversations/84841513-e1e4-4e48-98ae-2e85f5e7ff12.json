    "content": "Just learn. Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a predictor of success. In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on schleps, but this sort of work is merely unglamorous, not bogus. Most successful founders would probably say that if they'd known when they were starting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome, they might never have started it. Maybe that's one reason the most successful startups of all so often have young founders. In practice the founders grow with the problems. So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make two mistakes that cancel each other out. They don't know how much they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to. Older founders only make the first mistake. That's why our motto is \"Make something people want.\" This is always a good thing for companies to do, but it's even more important early on, because it sets the bounds for every other question. Who you hire, how much money you raise, how you market yourself--they all depend on what you're making. Because the early problems are so much about technology and design, you probably need to be hackers to do what we do. It's possible you could meet a cofounder through something like a user's group or a conference. But I wouldn't be too optimistic. You need to work with someone to know whether you want them as a cofounder. The real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder, but that you should start startups when you're young and there are lots of them around. No idea In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea, because most startups change their idea anyway. In the average Y Combinator startup, I'd guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of the first three months. Sometimes it's 100%.",
